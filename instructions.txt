# Instructions for Creating Quiz Data Files

## General Guidelines
1. Each quiz file should follow the same structure as the existing files (quizDataW1.js, quizDataW2.js, etc.)
2. Validate the number of questions at the start and end of each quiz parsing process
3. Ensure consistent formatting across all files
4. Include detailed explanations for each answer
5. Maintain proper JavaScript syntax and export statements

## File Structure
Each quiz file should contain:
```javascript
const quizData = {
  "Week X": {  // or "Quiz X" for quizDataQn.js files
    title: "Week X Quiz: [Topic]",
    questions: [
      {
        type: "multiple-choice" or "true-false",
        text: "Question text",
        options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],  // for multiple-choice only
        correctAnswerIndex: 0,  // index of correct option or 0/1 for true/false
        explanation: "Detailed explanation of the correct answer"
      },
      // ... more questions
    ]
  }
};

export default quizData;
```

## Specific Instructions for Each File

### quizDataW6.js
1. Read the content from split_quizzes/quiz6.md
2. Count the number of questions in the file
3. Read the answer key from split_quizzes/quiz6_answers.md
4. Create the file with the title "Week 6 Quiz: More on Callbacks continued, Computer Viewing & Projection"
5. Format each question with its type, text, options (if multiple-choice), correct answer, and explanation
6. Verify the total number of questions matches the count from step 2
7. Export the quiz data

### quizDataQ1.js through quizDataQ5.js
1. Read the content from split_quizzes_2/quiz1.md through quiz5.md
2. Count the number of questions in each file
3. Read the corresponding answer keys from split_quizzes_2/quiz1_answers.md through quiz5_answers.md
4. Create each file with the appropriate title from the quiz content
5. Format each question with its type, text, options (if multiple-choice), correct answer, and explanation
6. Verify the total number of questions matches the count from step 2
7. Export the quiz data

## Validation Steps
For each quiz file:
1. Count questions in the source markdown file before parsing
2. Count questions in the created JavaScript file after parsing
3. Ensure both counts match
4. Verify that all questions have:
   - A valid type ("multiple-choice" or "true-false")
   - Question text
   - Options array (for multiple-choice questions)
   - A correct answer index
   - An explanation
5. Check that the file exports the quiz data correctly
