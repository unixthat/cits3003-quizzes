Coordinate Systems
Content
```

- €¢ Intro. to the elements of geometry:
- €¢ points, scalars and vectors
- €¢ Dimensionality and linear independence
- €¢ Intro. to coordinate frame
- €¢ Learn how to define and change coordinate frames
- €¢ Derive homogeneous coordinate transformation

```cpp
matrices
Points, Scalars and Vectors
```

- €¢ Point (fundamental geometric object)
â€“ Location in space/coordinate system

```cpp
y
```

- €¢ Example: Point (3, 4)
â€“ Cannot add or scale points
(0,0)
â€“ mathematical point has neither a size nor a shape
(3,4)

```cpp
x
```

- €¢ Scalars
â€“ Real /complex numbers
â€“ Used to specify quantities
â€“ Obey a set of rules
- €¢ addition and multiplication
- €¢ commutivity and associativity // a + b = b + a ; (a + b) + c= a + (b + c)
- €¢ multiplicative and additive inverses // a + (-a) = 0 ; a . ğ‘ğ‘âˆ’1= 1

```cpp
Points, Scalars and Vectors
```

- €¢ Vector
â€“ Is any quantity with direction and magnitude
- €¢ e.g., Force, velocity etc.
â€“ Can be added, scaled and rotated
â€“ A vector does not have a fixed location in space

```cpp
Directed line
segment
Parallel &
scaled
Inverse vectors
Point-vector
addition
Identical
vectors
Vector
addition
Vector-Point Relationship
For computer graphics:
```

â€“ scalars are the real numbers using ordinary addition and multiplication.
â€“ geometric points are locations in space,
â€“ and vectors are directed line segments.

```cpp
These objects obey the rules of an affine space.
```

â€“ Vector-vector addition
â€“ Scalar-vector multiplication
â€“ Point-vector addition
â€“ Scalar-scalar operations
â€“ No point-point addition
- €¢ For any point define
â€“ 1â€¢P=P
â€“ 0 â€¢ P = 0 (zero vector)

```cpp
No other point-scalar operations
Vector-Point Relationship
```

- €¢ Vector
â€“ Two points can be thought of defining a vector,

```cpp
i.e., point-point-subtraction
```

ğ’—ğ’— = ğ‘·ğ‘· âˆ’ ğ‘¸ğ‘¸
- €¢ Subtract 2 Points = vector
- €¢ Point + vector =point
â€“ Because vectors can be multiplied by scalars,

```cpp
expressions, below make sense
```

ğ‘·ğ‘· + ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘
â€“ But this does not
ğŸğŸğŸğŸ âˆ’ ğ‘¸ğ‘¸ + ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘
ğ‘·ğ‘· + ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ âˆ’ ğ’—ğ’—

```cpp
Magnitude of a Vector
```

- €¢ Magnitude of a

```cpp
The magnitude of a vector a is a real number
denoted
```

â€“ If a =(2, 5, 6)
- €¢ Normalizing a vector

```cpp
Dot and Cross Products
```

- €¢ Many of the geometric concepts relating the orientation

```cpp
between two vectors are in terms of the dot (inner) and cross
```

(outer) products of two vectors.

```cpp
Dot and Cross Products
```

- €¢ Dot (inner) product:
ğ‘¢ğ‘¢ ï¿½ ğ‘£ğ‘£ = ğ‘¢ğ‘¢ ğ‘£ğ‘£ cos ğœƒğœƒ
â€“ angle between two vectors
â€“ Finding a vectorâ€™s magnitude
- €¢ Square of magnitude
â€“ Finding whether two vectors are perpendicular,
- €¢ If u.v = 0, u and v are orthogonal
â€“ Finding whether two vectors are parallel but pointing

```cpp
in opposite directions.
Dot and Cross Products
```

- €¢ Cross (outer) product
â€“ Given by u x v = |u||v| sin(Î¸)
â€“ Normal

```cpp
An important property of the cross product of two vectors, is
that it produces a vector that is normal (perpendicular) to the
plane defined by the original two vectors.
Linear Independence
```

- €¢ A set of vectors v1, v2, â€¦, vn is linearly independent

```cpp
when
a1v1+a2v2+.. anvn = 0,
only if a1=a2=â€¦= 0
```

- €¢ If a set of vectors is linearly independent, we cannot

```cpp
represent any vector (in the set) in terms of the other
vectors.
```

- €¢ If a set of vectors is linearly dependent, at least one

```cpp
can be written in terms of the others
Examples
```

- €¢ Example#1:
ïƒ˜v1=[1,2]T , v2=[-5,3]T

```cpp
Independent
```

- €¢ Example#2:
ïƒ˜v1=[2,-1,1]T , v2=[3,-4,2]T, v3=[5,-5,3]T

```cpp
Dependent
Linear Independence (cont.)
```

- €¢ For example:

```cpp
Let
```

ğ¯ğ¯1 = 0 , ğ¯ğ¯2 = 3 , ğ¯ğ¯3 = 0
âˆ’2

```cpp
then ğ¯ğ¯1 , ğ¯ğ¯2 , ğ¯ğ¯3 is a set of linearly independent vectors.
```

- €¢ What are the values of ğ›¼ğ›¼1 , ğ›¼ğ›¼2 , and ğ›¼ğ›¼3 if we want
ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3 = ğŸğŸ?

```cpp
Linear Independence (cont.)
```

- €¢ What are the values of ğ›¼ğ›¼1 , ğ›¼ğ›¼2 , and ğ›¼ğ›¼3 if we want ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 +
ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3 = ğŸğŸ?
- €¢ That is, we want
ğ›¼ğ›¼1
0 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 3 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 0 = 0
âˆ’2
ğ›¼ğ›¼1
âŸº ğ›¼ğ›¼2 = 0
ğ›¼ğ›¼3
âŸº ğ›¼ğ›¼1 = ğ›¼ğ›¼2 = ğ›¼ğ›¼3 = 0

```cpp
Dimension
```

- €¢

```cpp
In a vector space, the maximum number of linearly
independent vectors is fixed and is called the dimension of
the space
```

- €¢

```cpp
In an n-dimensional space, any set of n linearly
independent vectors form a basis for the space
```

- €¢

```cpp
Given a basis v1, v2, ..., vn, any vector w can be written as
w = a1v1+ a2v2 +â€¦.+anvn
where the coefficients {ai } are unique and are called
representations of w with respect to the basis {v1, v2, ..., vn}
A 3-dimensional space can
have 4 linearly independent
vectors?
```

â“˜ Start presenting to display the poll results on this slide.

```cpp
Dimension (cont.)
Let us define a basis ğ¯ğ¯1 = 0 , ğ¯ğ¯2 = 1 , ğ¯ğ¯3 = 0 .
```

- €¢

```cpp
Orthonormal basis vectors
The vector ğ°ğ° can be written as:
```

ğ°ğ° = 10.5 ğ¯ğ¯1 + 21.3 ğ¯ğ¯2 + 0.9 ğ¯ğ¯3

```cpp
and the coefficients ğ›¼ğ›¼1 = 10.5, ğ›¼ğ›¼2 = 21.3, and ğ›¼ğ›¼3 = 0.9 are
unique
In a three-dimensional vector
space, we can represent any
vector w uniquely in terms of
any three linearly independent
vectors, v1, v2, and v3
Coordinate Systems
```

- €¢ Which one is correct?

```cpp
v3
v3
v2
w
v1
v2
w
v1
```

- €¢ Both are correct, because vectors have no fixed

```cpp
location
Coordinate Systems
```

- €¢ We need a frame of reference to relate points and

```cpp
objects to our physical world.
o For example, where is a point? We canâ€™t answer
this without a reference system
Coordinate Frame
```

- €¢ Basis vectors alone cannot represent points
- €¢ We can add a single point, the origin, to the

```cpp
basis vectors to form a coordinate frame
v2
P0
v1
v3
Coordinate Frame
```

- €¢ A coordinate system (or coordinate frame) is

```cpp
determined by the origin and the basis vectors
```

ğğ0 , ğ¯ğ¯1 , ğ¯ğ¯2 , ğ¯ğ¯3
- €¢ Within this coordinate frame, every vector w can be

```cpp
written as
w = Î± 1v 1+ Î± 2v 2 + Î± 3v 3
Every point can be written as
P = P0 + Î²1v1+ Î²2v2 + Î²3v3
for some ğ›¼ğ›¼1 , ğ›¼ğ›¼2 , ğ›¼ğ›¼3 , and ğ›½ğ›½1 , ğ›½ğ›½2 , ğ›½ğ›½3
Representation in a Coordinate Frame
```

- €¢

```cpp
Consider a basis v1, v2, â€¦, vn
```

- €¢

```cpp
A vector w is written w = a1v1+ a2v2 +â€¦.+anvn
```

- €¢

```cpp
The list of scalars {a1, a2, â€¦. an} is the representation of
w with respect to the given basis
```

- €¢

```cpp
We can write the representation as a row or column matrix
```

ğ›¼ğ›¼1
ğ›¼ğ›¼
â‹¯ ğ›¼ğ›¼ğ‘›ğ‘› T = 2
â‹®
ğ›¼ğ›¼ğ‘›ğ‘›

```cpp
Coordinate systems (cont.)
For example, let ğ°ğ° = 2ğ¯ğ¯1 + 3ğ¯ğ¯2 âˆ’ 4ğ¯ğ¯3 .
If ğ¯ğ¯1 = 1 0 0 T ,
```

ğ¯ğ¯2 = 0 1 0 T ,

```cpp
and ğ¯ğ¯3 = 0 0 1 T ,
then ğœ¶ğœ¶ = 2
```

âˆ’4 T

```cpp
Note that this representation is with respect to a particular
basis
Homogeneous Coordinates
```

- €¢ Consider the point P and the vector v, where

```cpp
P = P0 + Î²1v1+ Î²2v2 + Î²3v3
w = Î±1v1+ Î±2v2 + Î±3v3
```

- €¢ They appear to have similar representations:

```cpp
P = [Î²1, Î²2, Î²3]T , w =[Î±1, Î±2, Î±3]T which
w
P
confuses the point with the vector
w
A vector has no position
Vector can be placed anywhere
P0
point: fixed
Representation in a Coordinate Frame
c =[c1, c2, c3]T
Representation of a vector or a point?
A Single Representation
```

- €¢ Assuming 0 ï¿½ ğğ = ğŸğŸ and 1 ï¿½ ğğ = ğğ , we can write
ğ°ğ° = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3 = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3 + 0 ï¿½ ğğ0
ğğ = ğ›½ğ›½1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›½ğ›½2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›½ğ›½3 ğ¯ğ¯3 + ğğ0 = ğ›½ğ›½1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›½ğ›½2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›½ğ›½3 ğ¯ğ¯3 + 1 ï¿½ ğğ0
- €¢ Thus, we obtain the four-dimensional homogeneous

```cpp
coordinate representation
```

ğ°ğ° = ğ›¼ğ›¼1
ğğ = ğ›½ğ›½1
ğ›¼ğ›¼2
ğ›½ğ›½2

ğ‘¤ğ‘¤ğ‘§ğ‘§
ğ‘¤ğ‘¤ T = ğ‘¥ğ‘¥ğ‘¥
ğ‘¦ğ‘¦ğ‘¦
ğ‘§ğ‘§ğ‘§
- €¢ We return to a three-dimensional point (for ğ‘¤ğ‘¤ â‰  0) by
ğ‘¥ğ‘¥ â† ğ‘¥ğ‘¥ â€² /ğ‘¤ğ‘¤
ğ‘¦ğ‘¦ â† ğ‘¦ğ‘¦ â€² /ğ‘¤ğ‘¤
ğ‘§ğ‘§ â† ğ‘§ğ‘§ â€² /ğ‘¤ğ‘¤
ğ‘¤ğ‘¤ T
- €¢ If ğ‘¤ğ‘¤ = 0, the representation is that of a vector
- €¢ Homogeneous coordinates replace points in three dimensions by

```cpp
lines through the origin in four dimensions
```

- €¢ For ğ‘¤ğ‘¤ = 1, the representation of a point is ğ‘¥ğ‘¥

```cpp
Homogeneous Coordinates and Computer
Graphics
```

- €¢ Homogeneous coordinates are key to all computer

```cpp
graphics systems
```

â€“ All standard transformations (rotation, translation, scaling)

```cpp
can be implemented with matrix multiplications using 4 x 4
matrices
```

â€“ Hardware pipeline works with 4 dimensional representations
â€“ For orthographic viewing, we can maintain w = 0 for

```cpp
vectors and w = 1 for points
```

â€“ For perspective viewing we need a perspective division

```cpp
Change of Coordinate System
```

- €¢ Letâ€™s consider transformation of two bases
â€“ {v1, v2, v3} and {u1, u2, u3} are two bases.
â€“ Each basis vector in the second set can be

```cpp
represented in terms of the first basis
```

ğ°ğ°

```cpp
The same vector w represented in two
coordinate systems
```

- €¢ Consider the same vector w with respect to two different coordinate

```cpp
systems having basis vectors ğ¯ğ¯1 , ğ¯ğ¯2 , ğ¯ğ¯3 and ğ®ğ®1 , ğ®ğ®2 , ğ®ğ®3 . Suppose that
```

ğ°ğ° = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3
ğ°ğ° = ğ›½ğ›½1 ğ®ğ®1 + ğ›½ğ›½2 ğ®ğ®2 + ğ›½ğ›½3 ğ®ğ®3
- €¢ Then the representations are:
- €¢ Equivalently,
ğšğš = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ›¼ğ›¼2
ğ›ğ› = ğ›½ğ›½1 ğ›½ğ›½2
ğ›¼ğ›¼3 T
ğ›½ğ›½3 T
ğ°ğ° = ğšğšT v

```cpp
and ğ°ğ° = ğ›ğ›T u
```

ğ¯ğ¯ = ğ¯ğ¯1
ğ®ğ® = ğ®ğ®1
ğ¯ğ¯2
ğ®ğ®2
ğ¯ğ¯3 T
ğ®ğ®3 T

```cpp
Representing the Second Basis in
Terms of the First (cont.)
```

- €¢ In this example, we have ğ°ğ° = ğšğšT v and ğ°ğ° = ğ›ğ›T u

```cpp
So
```

- €¢ With ğ®ğ® = ğŒğŒğ¯ğ¯, we have
ğšğšT v = ğ›ğ›T u
ğšğšT v = ğ›ğ›T ğŒğŒğ¯ğ¯
â‡’ ğšğš = ğŒğŒ T ğ›ğ›
- €¢ Thus, ğšğš and ğ›ğ› are related by ğŒğŒ T

```cpp
Representation w.r.t the second basis (u)
Representation w.r.t first basis (v)
Change of Coordinate System
Example:
Suppose u and v are two basis related to each other as
follows:
We have a vector w that is represented in basis v as:
what will be its representation in u ?
Coordinate Frame
```

- €¢ We can also do all this in coordinate systems:

```cpp
Change of Coordinate Frames
```

- €¢ We can apply a similar process in homogeneous coordinates

```cpp
to the representations of both points and vectors
Consider two coordinate
frames:
```

(P0, v1, v2, v3)
(Q0, u1, u2, u3)

```cpp
v
v2
P0
u2
u1
v1
Q0
u3
```

- €¢ Any point or vector can be represented in either coordinate

```cpp
frame.
```

- €¢ We can represent (Q0, u1, u2, u3) in terms of (P0, v1, v2, v3)

```cpp
Representing One Coordinate Frame in
Terms of the Other
```

- €¢ We can extend what we did with the change of basis

```cpp

```

ğ®ğ®1 = ğ›¾ğ›¾11 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¾ğ›¾12 ğ¯ğ¯2 +ğ›¾ğ›¾13 ğ¯ğ¯3
ğ®ğ®2 = ğ›¾ğ›¾21 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¾ğ›¾22 ğ¯ğ¯2 +ğ›¾ğ›¾23 ğ¯ğ¯3
ğ®ğ®3 = ğ›¾ğ›¾31 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¾ğ›¾32 ğ¯ğ¯2 +ğ›¾ğ›¾33 ğ¯ğ¯3
ğğ0 = ğ›¾ğ›¾41 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¾ğ›¾42 ğ¯ğ¯2 +ğ›¾ğ›¾43 ğ¯ğ¯3 + ğğ0

```cpp

```cpp
Working with Representations
```

- €¢ Within the two coordinate frames any point or vector has a

```cpp
representation of the same form:
```

ğšğš = ğ›¼ğ›¼1
ğ›ğ› = ğ›½ğ›½1
ğ›¼ğ›¼2
ğ›½ğ›½2
ğ›¼ğ›¼3
ğ›½ğ›½3
ğ›¼ğ›¼4 in the first frame
ğ›½ğ›½4 in the second frame

```cpp
where ğ›¼ğ›¼4 = ğ›½ğ›½4 = 1 for points and ğ›¼ğ›¼4 = ğ›½ğ›½4 = 0 for vectors and
```

ğšğš = ğŒğŒ T ğ›ğ›

```cpp
or
```

- €¢ The matrix ğŒğŒ T is 4 Ã— 4 and specifies an affine

```cpp
transformation in homogeneous coordinates

```

- €¢ Introduce standard transformations
â€“ Rotation, Translation, Scaling, Shear
- €¢ Learn to build arbitrary transformation

```cpp
matrices from simple transformations
Revision
```

- €¢ Vectors are entities having length and direction, but no

```cpp
position.
```

- €¢ The difference between two points is a vector:
ğ’—ğ’— = ğ‘·ğ‘· âˆ’ ğ‘¸ğ‘¸
- €¢ The sum of a point and a vector is a point:
ğ‘·ğ‘· = ğ’—ğ’— + ğ‘¸ğ‘¸

```cpp
we also say that a point P is formed by displacing point Q by vector v
```

- €¢ An n-dimensional vector is given by an n-tuple (list of its

```cpp
components)
representations of w with
w = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ›¼ğ›¼2 â‹¯ ğ›¼ğ›¼ğ‘›ğ‘› T
respect to the basis vectors

The Homogeneous representation of a
Point and a Vector
```

- €¢ Assuming 0 ï¿½ ğğ = ğŸğŸ and 1 ï¿½ ğğ = ğğ , we can write
ğ°ğ° = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3 = ğ›¼ğ›¼1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›¼ğ›¼2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›¼ğ›¼3 ğ¯ğ¯3 + 0 ï¿½ ğğ0
ğğ = ğ›½ğ›½1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›½ğ›½2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›½ğ›½3 ğ¯ğ¯3 + ğğ0 = ğ›½ğ›½1 ğ¯ğ¯1 + ğ›½ğ›½2 ğ¯ğ¯2 + ğ›½ğ›½3 ğ¯ğ¯3 + 1 ï¿½ ğğ0
- €¢ Thus, we obtain the four-dimensional homogeneous

Now, we want our frames to have different reference pointâ€¦.
Letâ€™s say, to the point Q0 that has the following representation in
the original system.
The MT for such a setting will be:

Identity Matrix
The identity matrix contains all zeros, with ones along the diagonal
Any point or matrix multiplied by the identity matrix is unchanged.
Transpose of a Matrix
The transpose of a matrix is computed by interchanging its rows and columns.

Transformation matrics
In graphics, matrices are typically used for performing
transformations on objects. For example, a matrix can be used to
move a point from one location to another. We will learn several
useful transformation matrices:

General Rotation About the Origin
A rotation angle of ğœƒğœƒ about the origin can be decomposed into the
concatenation of rotations about the ğ‘¥ğ‘¥, ğ‘¦ğ‘¦, and ğ‘§ğ‘§ axes

Frames in OpenGL
We had considered the following coordinate systems
```

1. Object (or model) coordinates
2. World coordinates
3. Eye (or camera) coordinates
4. Clip coordinates
5. Normalised device coordinates
6. Window (or screen) coordinates

```cpp

Change of Coordinate Frame
In OpenGL, we specify our geometry using the coordinate
system or frame that is natural for the model, which is known
as the object or model frame.
Models are then brought into the world frame
At some point, we want to know how these objects appear to
the camera. It is natural at that point to convert from the world
frame to the camera or eye frame
The conversion from the object frame to the eye frame is done
by the model-view matrix.
Object (Local) and World Space
```

- €¢ Object (Local or Model) space:
â€“ The space in which a model is defined, usually centered at

```cpp
the origin.
```

- €¢ World space:
â€“ The space in which a simulated scene is built

```cpp
The Model matrix
positions and orients
the object in the world
coordinate space.
Each model has its own
model matrix.
The matrix transforms (concatenated) that place an object
in world space is called its Model matrix, or M
Camera (or View or Eye) Space
```

- €¢ World space as seen from a simulated camera or â€œeyeâ€.

```cpp
Camera (or View or Eye) Space
```

- €¢ The View matrix moves and rotates the models in the world to

```cpp
simulate the effect of a camera at a desired location.
```

- €¢ OpenGL camera exists at location (0,0,0) and faces down the

```cpp
negative Z axis.
```

- €¢ To simulate the appearance of that camera being moved a

```cpp
certain way, we will need to move the objects themselves in
the opposite direction.
Transformations in Graphics pipeline
We had considered the following coordinate systems
Can be
```

1. Object (or model) coordinates

```cpp
Affine
combined in
```

2. World coordinates

```cpp
transform
model-view
```

3. Eye (or camera) coordinates

```cpp
transform
```

4. Clip coordinates
5. Normalised device coordinates
6. Window (or screen) coordinates

```cpp
The model-view
transformation brings
representations of geometric
objects from application or
model frame to the camera
frame.
The projection matrix will both
carry out the desired projection and
also change the representation to
clip coordinates.
Camera and Object Frames
Camera and object frame in default positions
```

ğ€ğ€ = 0

```cpp
model-view matrix
the camera is initially pointing in
the negative z-direction
Note that if we do not model with predefined objects or apply any transformations before we
specify our geometry, object and world coordinates are the same.
Camera and Object Frames
In most applications, we model our objects as being located around
the origin, so a camera located at the default position with the
default orientation does not see all the objects in the scene.
Thus, either:
```

- €¢ we must move the camera away from

```cpp
the objects that we wish to have in our image
Or
```

- €¢ the objects must be moved in front of the camera.

```cpp
These are equivalent operations, as either can be looked at as
positioning the frame of the camera with respect to the frame of the
objects.
Positioning Object frame

- €¢ In OpenGL, the base frame that we start with is the

```cpp
world frame
```

- €¢ Eventually we represent entities in the camera frame by

```cpp
changing the world representation using the modelview matrix
```

- €¢ Initially these frames are the same (i.e., M=I)
