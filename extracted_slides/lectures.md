About CITS3003
```

- Ä¢ Computer Graphics has many aspects:
‚Äì Computer Scientists create graphics programs and tools (e.g., Blender,

```cpp
Maya, photoshop)
```

- Ä¢ Includes C/C+, shader programming, maths, linear algebra, etc.,
‚Äì Artists use Computer Graphics packages to create photorealistic/creative

```cpp
pictures ‚Äì (does not involve maths or programming)
About CITS3003
CITS3003 teaches fundamentals of computer-generated threedimensional graphics and animation.
```

‚Äì It introduces OpenGL (Graphics library) for writing interactive

```cpp
graphics programs.
CITS3003 is:
```

‚Äì not about using software packages like Photoshop, Maya,

```cpp
GIMP
```

‚Äì not a comprehensive course on OpenGL, as only limited parts

```cpp
of the library are covered
```

‚Äì not a game development unit

Rendering
In general, one of the basic tasks of 3D graphics is producing 2D
images of the three-dimensional world.
Fundamentally, rendering is a process that takes as its input a set of
objects and produces as its output an array of pixels.
```

- Ä¢ the whole process of producing an image is referred to as

```cpp
rendering the scene.
Raster Image
A raster image is simply a 2D array that stores the pixel value for
each pixel‚Äîusually a color stored as three numbers, for red,
green, and blue.
Angel and Shreiner: Interactive
Computer Graphics 6E ¬© AddisonWesley 2012
Color Images
```

- Ä¢ Color Image

```cpp
o Has perceptional attributes of hue, saturation, and
lightness
Hue
another word for color
```

(wavelength dependent)

```cpp
Saturation (Chroma)
the intensity or purity of hue
```

(100% pure = no addition of gray)

```cpp
Lightness (Value)
relative degree of black/white
Image from (https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/hue-saturation-and-lightness/)
Luminance Images
```

- Ä¢ Luminance Image

```cpp
o Monochromatic
o Values are gray levels
o Analogous to working with black and white film
or television
Introduction to Image Formation
Image credits
Image Formation
```

- Ä¢ In computer graphics, we form/create images

```cpp
using a process analogous to how images are
formed by physical imaging systems
o Cameras
o Microscopes
o Telescopes
o Human visual system
Elements of Image Formation
```

1. Objects
2. Viewer
3. Light source(s)

```cpp
Note the independence of the objects, the viewer, and the
light source(s)
Objects
```

- Ä¢ A set of locations (vertices)

```cpp
in space is sufficient to
define or approximate most
objects
Viewer
```

- Ä¢ To form an image, we must have someone or

```cpp
something that is viewing our objects, be it a
human, a camera, or a digitizer. It is the viewer
that forms the image of our objects.
Light and Images
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
If there were no light sources, the objects would appear dark
Light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that causes a
reaction in our visual system
The details of the interaction
between light and the surfaces
of the object determine how
much light enters the camera.
Light and Images
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
If there were no light sources, the objects would appear dark
Light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that causes a
reaction in our visual system
Generally, these are wavelengths in the range of about 350750 nm (nanometers)
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Long wavelengths appear as reds and short wavelengths as blues
Imaging System
Pinhole Camera
```

- Ä¢ Use trigonometry to find projection of point at ùë•ùë•, ùë¶ùë¶, ùëßùëß
ùë•ùë•ùëùùëù ‚ÅÑùëßùëßùëùùëù = ùë•ùë• ‚ÅÑùëßùëß
ùë¶ùë¶ùëùùëù ‚ÅÑùëßùëßùëùùëù =ùë¶ùë¶‚ÅÑùëßùëß
ùëßùëßùëùùëù = ‚àíùëëùëë
- Ä¢ These are equations of simple perspective
- Ä¢ The point (ùë•ùë•ùëùùëù , ùë¶ùë¶ùëùùëù , ‚àíùëëùëë) is called the projection of the point (x, y, z).

```cpp
Pinhole Camera (cont..)
```

- Ä¢ The field, or angle of view of our camera is the

```cpp
angle made by the largest object that our camera
can image on its film plane.
```

- Ä¢ The ideal pinhole camera has an infinite Depth

```cpp
Of Field (DOF)
```

‚Äì DOF is the distance between the nearest and

```cpp
the farthest objects that are in acceptably
sharp focus in an image

Pinhole Camera (cont..)
```

- Ä¢ The field, or angle of view of our camera is the angle

```cpp
made by the largest object that our camera can image
on its film plane.
```

- Ä¢ The pinhole camera has two disadvantages:
‚Äì It admits only a single ray from a point source‚Äî

```cpp
almost no light enters the camera.
```

- Ä¢ Long exposure time
‚Äì The camera cannot be adjusted to have a different

```cpp
angle of view

Human Visual System
```

- Ä¢ The human visual system has two types of sensors
- Ä¢ Rods (up to 125M)
- Ä¢ Monochromatic, night vision
- Ä¢ Cones (6M+)
- Ä¢ Color sensitive
- Ä¢ Three types of cones
- Ä¢ Only three values (the tristimulus values) are sent to the

```cpp
brain
```

- Ä¢ That is, we need only match these three values
ÔÉ†Need only three primary colors- trichromatic color vision

```cpp
Color
Additive color
```

- Ä¢ Form a color by adding amounts of three

```cpp
primaries
```

- Ä¢ CRTs, projection systems, positive film
- Ä¢ Primaries are Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B)

```cpp
Subtractive color
```

- Ä¢ Form a color by filtering white light with cyan
(C), Magenta (M), and Yellow (Y) filters
- Ä¢ Light-material interactions
- Ä¢ Printing
- Ä¢ Negative film

```cpp
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color
Synthetic Camera Model
image is right way up
projector
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL uses the synthetic

```cpp
pin hole camera model
```

- Ä¢ Since the image of the

```cpp
object is flipped relative to
the object on the back of the
camera, we draw another
plane in front of the lens.
p (a point)
```

- Ä¢ With this synthetic camera

```cpp
image plane
model, the object is the right
projection of point p
way up.
center of projection
image is upside down
Synthetic Camera Model
Advantages
The synthetic-camera model is the basis for a number of
popular APIs, including OpenGL
It stresses the independence of objects, viewer, light
sources (can model them separately).
```

- Ä¢ Leads to simple software API
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Can specify objects, lights, camera, attributes separately
Let implementation determine image by interaction
```

- Ä¢ Leads to fast hardware implementation
- Ä¢ Two-dimensional graphics becomes a special case of

```cpp
three-dimensional graphics
Ray Tracing: Physical Approach to Image Formation
Ray tracing and OpenGL represent two
different methods of rendering images
in computer graphics
Ray tracing is a rendering algorithm
that simulates the physical behavior of
light. It traces the rays of light from a
source, finding which rays enter the
camera lens.
However, rays of light may have
multiple interactions with objects, get
absorbed, or go to infinity.
Languages and Libraries
Graphics Libraries
Modern graphics programming is done using a graphics library/
set of libraries
```

‚Äì most common library for platforming independent graphics

```cpp
programming is called OpenGL (Open Graphics Library).
```

‚Äì Using OpenGL with C++ requires configuring several

```cpp
libraries
We will use the following libraries:
```

‚Äì OpenGL / GLSL
‚Äì GLUT (window management)
‚Äì extension library

```cpp
Some more libraries will be used in the lab#06 and the project
```

‚Äì GLFW
‚Äì glm
‚Äì ImGui

```cpp
Introduction to OpenGL
What is OpenGL
OpenGL is a platform-independent Application
Programmers‚Äô Interface (API) that
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Is close enough to the hardware to get excellent performance
Provides a link between the low-level graphics hardware and the high-level
application program that you write
Is easy to use
Most of the concepts related to OpenGL covered in week 01 are for introduction purpose.
Many of these concepts will be repeated in more detail in the weeks to follow.
Variants of OpenGL
OpenGL ES
o Is suitable for embedded systems
o Version 1.0 is a simplified version of OpenGL 2.1
o Version 2.0 is a simplified version of OpenGL 3.1
o WebGL
o Is a derivative of OpenGL ES version 2.0
o Provides JavaScript bindings for OpenGL functions, allowing
an HTML page to render images using any GPU resources
available on the computer where the web browser is running
o WebGL and OpenGL ES are not included in the curriculum
Which Function is in which Library?
```

- Ä¢ You don‚Äôt need to memorize the functionalities of different

```cpp
OpenGL libraries
```

- Ä¢ Instead, you decide on your objects, lights and camera, then

```cpp
work out which OpenGL functions are required.
```

- Ä¢ Include libraries that contain your functions.
- Ä¢ For the practical issues you will have the OpenGL

```cpp
documentation to help.

What is OpenGL
```

- Ä¢ Its an API (specifications to be precise)
‚Äì Allows accessing and dealing with the graphics card
‚Äì Contains over 250 functions
‚Äì the latest OpenGL specification 4.6 was released in 2017
- Ä¢ Where do I download OpenGL?
‚Äì Its already there in your graphics driver
- Ä¢ Is it open source?
‚Äì Irrelevant (its essentially just a specification)
- Ä¢ We still treat OpenGL as API

```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Modern OpenGL (version 3.2+) allows the computer
program to achieve fast graphics performance by using
GPU rather than CPU
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Allows applications to control GPU through programs
known as shaders
```

- Ä¢ Non exhaustive list of OpenGL applications (link)

```cpp
Extension Library- GLEW
```

- Ä¢ Modern versions of OpenGL, such as those found in version
4+, require identifying the extensions available on the GPU.
- Ä¢ It has become standard practice to use an extension library to

```cpp
abstract away the extra coding used to identify and access the
OpenGL extensions on a GPU.
```

- Ä¢ GLEW is an OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
- Ä¢ GLEW makes it easy to access OpenGL extensions available

```cpp
on a particular system
```

- Ä¢ Application only needs to include glew.h and run a glewInit()

OpenGL as a State Machine
```

- Ä¢

```cpp

```

(finite-state machine).
- Ä¢

```cpp
This black box has inputs coming from the application
program.
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
These inputs can change the state (mode) of the machine or can cause the machine to
produce a visible output.
The behavior of Graphics system can be determined by its ‚Äústate‚Äù, which can
be modified by invoking OpenGL functions

OpenGL Context and State
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
OpenGL state machine consists of hundreds of settings that
affect various aspects of rendering.
The state of OpenGL is commonly referred to as the OpenGL
context.
The initial Graphics context has a number of default values for:
```

- Ä¢ color or other attributes
- Ä¢ transformations
- Ä¢ lighting mode, camera model, textures etc
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

```cpp
The OpenGL state as a graphics context object
OpenGL Context and State
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL maintains a list for the current values of attributes and

```cpp
other parameters, refers to as ‚Äústate variables‚Äù
```

‚Äì When we assign a value to one or more state

```cpp
variables, we put the systems into a particular state.
```

‚Äì State remains in effect until we change the value of a

```cpp
state variable.
```

‚Äì Each state variable has a default value.

```cpp
The OpenGL state as a graphics context object
State Machine (cont..)
```

- Ä¢ From the perspective of the API, there are two types of

```cpp
graphics functions:
```

1. Functions that either change the state inside the machine or

```cpp
return the state information
```

‚Äì glEnable ( GL_ LIGHTING );
‚Äì glDisable ( GL_BLEND );
2. Functions that perform some operations based on the current

```cpp
state of the machine.
```

- Ä¢ Primitive functions
‚Äì glColor3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
‚Äì glPointSize(1.5);

```cpp
OpenGL Functions
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL provides a range of functions for specifying:
- Ä¢ Primitives ÔÉ† the low-level objects or atomic entities that our system can display

```cpp
o Points
o Line Segments
o Triangles
```

- Ä¢ Attributes ÔÉ† the way that a primitive appears on the display
- Ä¢ Transformations ÔÉ† to carry out transformations of objects, such as rotation,

```cpp
translation, and scaling
```

- Ä¢ Viewing
ÔÉ† To specify various views
- Ä¢ Control (GLUT) ÔÉ† to communicate with the window system, initialize our

```cpp
programs, and deal with any errors during the execution
```

- Ä¢ Query ÔÉ† to get information about API i.e., how many colours are supported etc.,

```cpp
What are OpenGL Primitives?

- Ä¢

```cpp
In OpenGL, we use basic OpenGL types, e.g.,
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
GLfloat,
GLdouble,
GLint, etc
```

(equivalent to float, double, and int in C/C++)

```cpp
Additional data types are supplied in header files vec.h and
mat.h from Angel and Shreiner, e.g.,
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
vec2,
vec3,
mat2,
mat3
mat4, etc.
What are Attributes?
```

- Ä¢ Attributes are properties associated with the primitives that give

```cpp
them their different appearances, e.g.
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Color (for points, lines, polygons)
Size and width (for points, lines)
Stipple pattern (for lines, polygons)
Polygon mode
```

- Ä¢ Display as filled: solid color or stipple pattern
- Ä¢ Display edges
- Ä¢ Display vertices

```cpp
Attributes for lines
Attributes for polygons
OpenGL Functions:
Lack of Object Orientation
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
OpenGL is not object oriented so that there are multiple forms
of a given logical function, e.g., the following are the same
function but for different parameter types: (no overloading)
o
o
o
glUniform3f
glUniform2i
glUniform3fv
```

- Ä¢ The major reason is efficiency (Don‚Äôt wrap everything in classes

```cpp
when it is not required)
Format of OpenGL Functions
glUniform ‚Äî Specifies the value of a uniform variable for the current program object
function name
dimensions
glUniform3f(x,y,z)
belongs to GL library
x,y,z are floats
glUniform3fv(p)
p is a pointer to an array
Uniform variables are used to communicate with vertex or
fragment shaders from outside. We will come to the details later.
OpenGL #defines
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Most constants are defined in the include files gl.h, glu.h and
glut.h
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Note #include <GL/glut.h> should automatically include the others
Examples: the functions glEnable and glClear are both declared in
gl.h
The OpenGL data types GLfloat, GLdouble,‚Ä¶. are also
declared in gl.h
Which of the following options
is correct?

o
Built-in Matrix and vector types (2, 3, 4 dimensional)
C++ like constructors
It is similar to Nvidia‚Äôs Cg and Microsoft HLSL
Supports loops, if-else constructs, but recursion is not allowed
GLSL codes are not stand-alone applications, they require an
application program that uses OpenGL API
More on GLSL in later lectures
A Simple Program
simple.cpp - Generates a white square on a black
background
For the above task, following are the
Rendering Steps:
```

1. Generate vertices (2 triangle = 6 vertices)
2. Store the vertices into an array
3. Create GPU buffer for vertices
4. Move array of 6 vertices from CPU to GPU

```cpp

Polygons in OpenGL
Everything you see rendered on the screen is a collection of points,
lines, and triangles.
```

- Ä¢ Applications normally break complex surfaces into a very large number

```cpp
of triangles and send them to OpenGL
The only OpenGL polygons that OpenGL supports are triangles
```

- Ä¢ Triangles are easy to draw.
- Ä¢ We can approximate surfaces using collections of many triangles.

```cpp
Image credits: Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, 4th edition, Peter Shirley
Polygons in OpenGL
```

- Ä¢ Graphics systems like triangles because triangles are:

```cpp
o Simple: edges cannot cross
o Convex: All points on a line segment between two points
in a polygon are also in that polygon
o Flat: all vertices are in the same plane
Non-simple polygon
convexity
nonconvex polygon
Polygon Issues (cont.)
```

- Ä¢ In practice, we need to deal with more general polygons.
- Ä¢ If other polygons are used, Application program must

```cpp
tessellate a polygon into triangles (a.k.a triangulation)
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL 4.1 contains a tessellator.

```cpp
Tessellation (tiling) of a flat surface is the process of covering
it with one or more geometric shapes (the tiles): Wikipedia
Recursive Triangulation of
Convex Polygon
There are some simple algorithms to perform
triangulations for planar convex polygons.
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
d
c
For example:
```

1. Start with first three vertices and form b

```cpp
a triangle.
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Start with abc to form the 1st triangle
```

2. Remove the second vertex from the list

```cpp
of vertices
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
a
Remove b
```

3. (Recursion) Go to Step 1 to form the
2nd triangle
- Ä¢ Does not guarantee all triangles are good.

```cpp
Triangulation
Good and Bad Triangles
Although every set of vertices can be triangulated, not all
triangulations are equivalent.
Triangulation

Long, thin triangles render badly
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Equilateral triangles render well
To get good triangles for rendering
```

ÔÉ® Maximize the minimum interior angle

```cpp
Delaunay triangulation can be used for unstructured points
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Vertices and attributes
```

- Ä¢ Each triangle is made up of 3 vertices. Each

```cpp
vertex is associated with some numerical
data.
```

- Ä¢ Vertex Attributes
‚Äì Each data item associated with a vertex

```cpp
is called an attribute.
```

- Ä¢ location of the vertex (using 2 numbers for
2D geometry or 3 numbers for 3D geometry).
- Ä¢ color (using 3 numbers representing amounts

```cpp
of red, green and blue)
```

- Ä¢ material properties etc.

```cpp
A cat head is described by a
soup of triangles. Some of
the vertices are highlighted
with black dots.

Colour
How is color handled in a graphics system from the programmer‚Äôs
Perspective?
RGB Color model:
```

- Ä¢ Each colour component is stored separately in the frame buffer.
- Ä¢ Occupies 8 bits per component in the buffer.
- Ä¢ Colour values range:

```cpp
o from 0 to 255 using unsigned integers, or
o from 0.0 (none) to 1.0 (all) using floats
```

- Ä¢ Use vec3 or vec4 to represent colour

```cpp
vec4 red = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
R
G
B
Indexed Colour
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Colours are indices into tables of
RGB values
Requires less memory
o Indices usually 8 bits
o no longer part of recent
versions of OpenGL
The Graphics Pipeline
Image link
Pipeline Architectures
```

- Ä¢ Pipeline architectures are very common and can be found in many

```cpp
application domains. E.g., an arithmetic pipeline:
Arithmetic Pipeline
```

- Ä¢ When two sets of a, b, and c values are passed to the system, the

```cpp
multiplier can carry out the 2nd multiplication without waiting for
the adder to finish ÔÉ† the calculation time is shortened!

OpenGL Graphics Pipeline
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL utilizes the following pipeline (simplified version):

```cpp
application
program
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
display
Objects passed to the pipeline are processed one at a time in the
order they are generated by the application program
All steps can be implemented in hardware on the graphics card
Image credits: Author: Romain Vergne link
Vertex Processing
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Much of the work in the pipeline is in converting object
representations from one coordinate system to another
o Object coordinates
o Camera (eye) coordinates
o Screen coordinates
Every change of vertex coordinates is the result of a matrix
transformation being applied to the vertices
Vertex processor can also compute vertex colors
Projection
```

- Ä¢ Projection is the process that combines the 3D

```cpp
viewer with the 3D objects to produce the 2D image
o Perspective projections: all projected rays meet at the
center of projection
o Parallel projection: projected rays are parallel; center of
projection is at infinity. (specify the direction of
projection instead of the center of projection)
Projection
```

- Ä¢ Example
2D to 1D Orthographic/Parallel Projection
2D to 1D Perspective Projection

```cpp
The gray box represents the part of the world that is visible to the projection; parts of the scene outside of this region are not seen
Credits: link
Primitive Assembly
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Vertices must be collected into geometric objects before
clipping and rasterization can take place.
o Line segments
o Polygons
o Curves and surfaces
are formed by the grouping of vertices in this step of the
pipeline.
Clipping
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Just as a real camera cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù the whole world, the virtual
camera can only see part of the world or object space
o Objects that are not within this volume are said to be clipped out
of the scene
Rasterization
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
If an object is not clipped out, the appropriate pixels in the
frame buffer must be assigned colors.
Rasterizer produces a set of fragments for each object.
Fragments are ‚Äúpotential pixels‚Äù. They:
o have a location in the frame buffer
o have colour, depth, and alpha attributes
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
link
Vertex attributes (colour, transparency) are interpolated over
the objects by the rasterizer
Smooth Color
```

- Ä¢ We can tell the rasterizer in the pipeline how to interpolate

```cpp
the vertex colours across the vertices
```

- Ä¢ Default is smooth shading

```cpp
o OpenGL interpolates vertex
colors across visible polygon
```

- Ä¢ Alternative is flat shading

```cpp
o Color of the first vertex
determines the fill color
```

- Ä¢ Shading is handled in the fragment shader

```cpp
Fragment Processing
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Fragments are processed to determine the colour of the
corresponding pixel in the frame buffer.
The colour of a fragment can be determined by texture mapping
or by interpolation of vertex colours.
Fragments may be blocked by other fragments closer to the
camera
o Hidden-surface removal
Choose the correct option(s)
```

‚ìò Start presenting to display the poll results on this slide.

```cpp
Retained Mode Graphics
The application constructs a scene from graphics primitives,
such as triangles and lines, and the library stores a model of the
scene in the memory.
```

- Ä¢ Put all vertex data in array(s), send array(s) over and store on GPU

```cpp
for multiple renderings
```

‚Äì The application issues commands to update the scene (e.g.,

```cpp
add or remove shapes).
```

‚Äì The library is responsible for redrawing the scene.
‚Äì A retained-mode API is declarative.

```cpp
Image taken from docs.microsoft.com
Immediate Mode Graphics
```

- Ä¢ Older versions of OpenGL adopted immediate mode graphics,

```cpp
where:
```

‚Äì Each time a vertex is specified in application, its location is sent to the

```cpp
GPU.
```

‚Äì Old style programming, uses glVertex
‚Äì The library does not store a scene model between the frames.

```cpp
Example code of using immediate
mode to draw a simple triangle.
Image taken from docs.microsoft.com
Immediate Mode with OpenGL
```

- Ä¢ Advantage:
‚Äì No memory is required to store the geometric data (memory

```cpp
efficient)
```

- Ä¢ Disadvantages:
‚Äì As the vertices are not stored, if they need to be displayed

```cpp
again, the entire vertex creation and the display process must
be repeated.
```

‚Äì Creates bottleneck between CPU and GPU
- Ä¢ Immediate mode graphics has been removed from

```cpp
OpenGL 3.1
Retained Mode Graphics with OpenGL
```

- Ä¢ Put all vertex and attribute data into an array, send

```cpp
and store that on the GPU
```

- Ä¢ Update when required
- Ä¢ Retained mode graphics is adopted in OpenGL 3.1

```cpp
onward.
Comparison of the two modes
```

- Ä¢ Immediate mode graphics
- Ä¢ Retained mode graphics

```cpp
main()
{
initialize_the_system();
p = find_initial_point();
for (some_no_of_points) {
q = generate_a_point(p);
display(q);
p = q;

OpenGL Program
Usually has 3 files:
```

- Ä¢ simple.cpp file: containing your main function
‚Äì Does initialization, generates/loads geometry to be drawn
- Ä¢ Two shader files:
‚Äì Vertex shader: functions to manipulate (e.g., move) vertices
‚Äì Fragment shader: functions to manipulate pixels/fragments
(e.g., change color)

```cpp
A Simple Program (cont.)
```

- Ä¢ Most ‚Äò.cpp‚Äô (simple.cpp in our case) files have a similar structure

```cpp
that consists of the following functions:
o main(): creates the window, calls the init() function,
specifies callback functions relevant to the application, enters
event loop (last executable statement)
o A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument,
which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of
routine or action
o init(): defines the vertices, attributes, etc. of the objects to be
rendered, specifies the shader programs,
o display(): this is a callback function that defines what to
draw whenever the window is drawn/refreshed.

- Ä¢ glutCreateWindow creates a window

```cpp

```

- Ä¢ glutMainLoop enters infinite event loop

```cpp
o never returns, but may exit
Callback Functions (Recall..):
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
A callback function is a function which the library (GLUT) calls when it needs
to know how to process events.
Register callbacks for all events your program will react to
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
No registered callback = no action
```

‚Äì Example:
- Ä¢ Declare function myMouse, to be called on mouse click
- Ä¢ Register it: glutMouseFunc(myMouse)

```cpp
GLUT functions (cont.)
Callback Registration
GLUT supports a number of callbacks to respond to events.
```

‚Äì glutDisplayFunc sets the display callback
‚Äì glutKeyboardFunc sets the keyboard callback
‚Äì glutReshapeFunc sets the window resize callback
‚Äì glutTimerFunc sets the timer callback
‚Äì glutIdleFunc sets the idle callback

```cpp
OpenGl programs are
event-driven:

Vertex Buffer Objects
```

- Ä¢ Vertex buffers objects (VBO) allow us to transfer large amounts of

```cpp
data to the GPU
```

- Ä¢ Need to create and bind the VBO then copy the vertices to the

```cpp
buffer:
```

\\ create buffer object

```cpp
Gluint buffer;
glGenBuffers(1, &buffer);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer); \\ make the VBO active
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(position), position, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

\\ move data to buffer object

```cpp
Vertex Buffer Object (cont.)
How to update a portion of the data in an existing buffer object?
```

- Ä¢ glBufferSubData allows you to replace all or part of the data

```cpp
within the buffer
vec2 position[] = {...};
vec3 colour[] = {...};
```

//create a larger buffer to hold both points and colours

```cpp
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(position) +
sizeof(colour), NULL, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

//load data separately

```cpp
glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, sizeof(position), position);
offset
glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(position), sizeof(colour), colour); 31
Vertex Buffer Object (cont.)
```

- Ä¢ Can also specify more than one buffer object, e.g., 2

```cpp
buffer objects:
GLuint buffer[2];
glGenBuffers(2, buffer);
```

//do the binding and send the data for the 1st buffer
//to the GPU

```cpp
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer[0]);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(points), position);
```

//do the same for the 2nd buffer object

```cpp
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer[1]);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,sizeof(colour), colour);
position could be an array of vec2, vec3, or vec4.
colour could be an array of vec3 or vec4.

```

(variable colour)

```cpp

buffer[0] and
buffer[1]
Display Callback
```

- Ä¢ Once we get data to GPU, we can initiate the rendering with a

```cpp
simple display callback function:
void mydisplay()
{
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
}
The display callback
function is called every
time the window needs
to be repainted.
```

// glFlush(); // Single buffering

```cpp
glutSwapBuffers(); // Double buffering
```

- Ä¢ Prior to this, the vertex buffer objects should contain the vertex

```cpp
data.

Coordinate Frames
OpenGL commonly uses the following coordinate frames
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Object (Local) Coordinates
World Coordinates
Camera (View) Coordinates
Clip Coordinates
Window (or screen) Coordinates
Figure Credits LInk
Coordinate Frames
Object Coordinates
This is the coordinate frame which is local to an
object.
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
We can define shapes of individual objects such as boxes,
trees or mountains, within a separate coordinate frame for
each object.
World Coordinates
The coordinates in which you build the complete scene
are called world coordinates.
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Each virtual world may contain 100‚Äôs of objects.
The application program applies a sequence of
transformations to orient and scale each object before
placing them in the virtual world.
Coordinate Frames
Camera (View) Coordinates
Camera coordinates are used to specify the
position of objects relative to the camera
```

(viewer‚Äôs) position
- Ä¢ the camera/viewer is at the origin and looking

```cpp
into the negative z-direction. However, this can
be altered in the program.
Coordinate Frames
Clip Coordinates
Clip coordinates are used to specify the position of the objects relative
to the clipping plane. Objects that are not inside the view volume are
clipped out. Clip coordinates are used to operate in the clip space.
Window (or screen) Coordinates
This is the final coordinate system in which the output is rendered. Also
known as device or screen coordinates. Window coordinates are
expressed as a pair of numbers (x, y), which correspond to the position
of an object on the screen.
Orthographic Vs Perspective
Projection
We can either use Orthographic projection or perspective projection matrices to transform view
coordinates to clip coordinates, where each form defines its own unique frustum.
Orthographic projection
```

- Ä¢ cube-like frustum box that defines the

```cpp
clipping space
```

- Ä¢ each vertex outside this box is clipped

```cpp
Perspective projection
```

- Ä¢ a non-uniformly shaped frustum box defines the

```cpp
clipping space
```

- Ä¢ each vertex outside this box is clipped
- Ä¢ field of view and sets how large the viewspace is

```cpp
Credits: link
Viewports
```

- Ä¢ We do not have to use the

```cpp
entire window to render the
scene, e.g., we can set the
viewport like this:
glViewport(x,y,w,h)
```

- Ä¢ Values passed to this

```cpp
function should be in pixels
```

(window coordinates)
- Ä¢ We can create multiple

```cpp
viewports in the same
window
For example, if we want to draw two scenes, sideby-side, and that the drawing surface is 600-by400 pixels. An outline for how to do that is very
simple:
The OpenGL Camera
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL places a camera at the origin in the view coordinate space pointing

```cpp
in the negative z direction
```

- Ä¢ The default viewing volume is a box centered at the origin with sides of

```cpp
length 2

- Ä¢ Using OpenGL to render 3D images generally

```cpp
involves sending data through the OpenGL shader
pipeline. For example, to draw a simple 3D object
such as a cube, you will need to at least send the
following items:
```

‚Äì the vertices for the cube model
‚Äì some transformation matrices to control the

```cpp
appearance of the cube‚Äôs orientation in 3D space
How to send data from Application to

‚Äì attribute, uniform, varying (these are storage qualifiers)
‚Äì highp, mediump, lowp (these are precision qualifiers)
‚Äì in, out, inout (these are parameter qualifiers)

```cpp

Storage Qualifiers
Qualifier Constant
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
The qualifier const is used the same as in Java. It specifies that the value assigned to a
variable is constant and cannot be changed. The variable is read only. Here are a legal
and illegal statement.
```

// a vector assigned a value

```cpp
const vec4 point = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0);
```

// illegal statement because the const variable must be initialized when declared

Qualifier attribute
```

- Ä¢ Uniform variables:
‚Äì can appear in the vertex shader and the fragment shader
‚Äì must have a global scope.
‚Äì do not change from one shader invocation to the next within a particular

```cpp
rendering call thus their value is uniform among all invocations
```

- Ä¢ If a uniform variable is used in both shaders, its declaration must

```cpp
be identical in both.
The Qualifier uniform (cont.)
```

- Ä¢ uniform variables remain constant across a graphics primitive.

```cpp
They can be used to describe global properties that affect the
scene to be rendered, e.g., projection matrix, light source position,
etc. or object properties (e.g., colour, materials). e.g.,
uniform mat4 projection;
uniform float temperature;
```

- Ä¢ Variables declared as uniform are not changeable within the vertex

```cpp

```

- Ä¢ The varying qualifier can only be used with floating point scalar,

```cpp
floating point vectors and (floating point) matrices as well as arrays
containing these types.
```

- Ä¢ Example: the vertex shader can compute the color of the incoming

```cpp
vertex and then pass the value forward for interpolation. In both
shaders:

Precision Qualifiers
The Qualifiers highp, mediump,
lowp, and precision
```

- Ä¢ Supported for compatibility with OpenGL ES
‚Äì Use is not recommended unless OpenGL ES compatibility is

```cpp
required
```

- Ä¢ The highp, mediump, and lowp qualifiers are used to specify the

```cpp
highest, medium, and lowest precision available for a variable. All
these qualifiers can appear in the vertex and fragment shaders.
```

- Ä¢ All variables of a certain type can be declared to have a precision

```cpp
by using the precision qualifier

e.g., float
The Qualifiers highp, mediump,
lowp, and precision
```

- Ä¢ The default precision is highp.
- Ä¢ Using a lower precision might have a positive effect on performance
(frame rates) and power efficiency but might also cause a loss in

```cpp
rendering quality. The appropriate trade-off can only be determined
by testing different precision configurations.
Parameter Qualifiers
The Qualifiers in, out & inout
Function Parameter Qualifiers

The values passed to functions are copied into parameters when the
function is called, and outputs are copied out when the function
returns (‚Äúvalue-return‚Äù calling convention)

ÔÅ± A parameter declared as in is intended to have a value when it is passed into a

```cpp
function but is not to be changed in the function.
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Such parameters are intended to communicate only from the calling function to
the called function.
```

ÔÅ± The out parameter is not assumed to have an initial value the first time it appears

```cpp
in the function. But it is assumed that a value will be assigned before the function
returns.
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Such parameters are intended to communicate only from the called function to
the calling function.
```

ÔÅ± The inout parameter is intended to have a value when it is passed into a function

```cpp
and to have a value, possibly different, when the function returns.
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Such parameters are intended to provide two-way communication between the
called function and the calling function.
The Qualifiers in, out & inout
```

- Ä¢ The in and out qualifiers supersede the attribute and varying

```cpp
qualifiers in GLSL version 130+ onward:
```

‚Äì attribute is replaced by in in the vertex shader
‚Äì varying in the vertex shader is replaced by out
‚Äì varying in the fragment shader is replace by in

```cpp
An out variable is to get its value in the shader where it is defined and be passed from that
shader to the next shader further along in the shader pipeline. It is a write-only variable in
the shader where it is defined.
An in variable is to be received from a previous shader/application in the pipeline and used
in the shader where it is defined. It is a read-only variable in the shader where it is defined.

- Ä¢ Swizzling operator lets us manipulate components easily,

```cpp
e.g.,
vec4 a; // (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
a.yz = vec4(1.0, 2.0); // (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 0.0)
vec4 newColour = a.bgra; // swap red and blue // (2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
This lets you rearrange or reorganize the components of a vector.
You can also duplicate some of the components of a vector
Selection and Swizzling with
Matrices
```

- Ä¢ Swizzling does not work with matrices. You can instead

```cpp
access a matrix's fields with array syntax:
mat3 theMatrix;
theMatrix[1] = vec3(3.0, 3.0, 3.0); // Sets the 2nd column
theMatrix[2][0] = 16.0; // Sets the 1st entry of 3rd column
```

- Ä¢ However, the result of the first array accessor is a vector, so

```cpp
you can swizzle that:
mat3 theMatrix;
theMatrix[1].yzx = vec3(3.0, 1.0, 2.0);

i.e., point-point-subtraction
```

ùíóùíó = ùë∑ùë∑ ‚àí ùë∏ùë∏

```

- Ä¢ Cross (outer) product
‚Äì Given by u x v = |u||v| sin(Œ∏)
‚Äì Normal

```cpp
An important property of the cross product of two vectors, is
that it produces a vector that is normal (perpendicular) to the
plane defined by the original two vectors.
Linear Independence
```

- Ä¢ A set of vectors v1, v2, ‚Ä¶, vn is linearly independent

```cpp
when
a1v1+a2v2+.. anvn = 0,
only if a1=a2=‚Ä¶= 0

represent any vector (in the set) in terms of the other
vectors.

translation vector. Rigid transformation preserves
everything (angle (this means the shape), length, area, etc.,)
```

Frames in OpenGL
We had considered the following coordinate systems
```

1. Object (or model) coordinates
2. World coordinates
3. Eye (or camera) coordinates
4. Clip coordinates
5. Normalised device coordinates
6. Window (or screen) coordinates

```cpp
Image credits: Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th Edition)-Peter Shirley
Change of Coordinate Frame
In OpenGL, we specify our geometry using the coordinate
system or frame that is natural for the model, which is known
as the object or model frame.
Models are then brought into the world frame
At some point, we want to know how these objects appear to
the camera. It is natural at that point to convert from the world
frame to the camera or eye frame
The conversion from the object frame to the eye frame is done
by the model-view matrix.
Object (Local) and World Space
```

- Ä¢ Object (Local or Model) space:
‚Äì The space in which a model is defined, usually centered at

```cpp
the origin.
```

- Ä¢ World space:
‚Äì The space in which a simulated scene is built

```cpp
The Model matrix
positions and orients
the object in the world
coordinate space.
Each model has its own
model matrix.
The matrix transforms (concatenated) that place an object
in world space is called its Model matrix, or M
Camera (or View or Eye) Space
```

- Ä¢ World space as seen from a simulated camera or ‚Äúeye‚Äù.

```cpp
Camera (or View or Eye) Space
```

- Ä¢ The View matrix moves and rotates the models in the world to

```cpp
simulate the effect of a camera at a desired location.
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL camera exists at location (0,0,0) and faces down the

```cpp
negative Z axis.
```

- Ä¢ To simulate the appearance of that camera being moved a

```cpp
certain way, we will need to move the objects themselves in
the opposite direction.
Transformations in Graphics pipeline
We had considered the following coordinate systems
Can be
```

1. Object (or model) coordinates

```cpp
Affine
combined in
```

2. World coordinates

```cpp
transform
model-view
```

3. Eye (or camera) coordinates

```cpp
transform
```

4. Clip coordinates
5. Normalised device coordinates
6. Window (or screen) coordinates

```cpp
The model-view
transformation brings
representations of geometric
objects from application or
model frame to the camera
frame.
The projection matrix will both
carry out the desired projection and
also change the representation to
clip coordinates.
Camera and Object Frames
Camera and object frame in default positions
```

ùêÄùêÄ = 0

```cpp
model-view matrix
the camera is initially pointing in
the negative z-direction
Note that if we do not model with predefined objects or apply any transformations before we
specify our geometry, object and world coordinates are the same.
Camera and Object Frames
In most applications, we model our objects as being located around
the origin, so a camera located at the default position with the
default orientation does not see all the objects in the scene.
Thus, either:
```

- Ä¢ we must move the camera away from

```cpp
the objects that we wish to have in our image
Or
```

- Ä¢ the objects must be moved in front of the camera.

```cpp
These are equivalent operations, as either can be looked at as
positioning the frame of the camera with respect to the frame of the
objects.
Positioning Object frame

Camera frame is fixed, we are placing object frame relative to

A Graphics System
There are six major elements in a graphics system
```

‚Äì Input devices
‚Äì Central Processing Unit
‚Äì Graphics Processing Unit
‚Äì Memory
‚Äì Frame Buffer
‚Äì Output Devices

```cpp
A Graphics System
Input Devices
```

- Ä¢ Input devices can be viewed as:
‚Äì Physical Devices
‚Äì Logical Devices

```cpp
what it is
Vs. what it does
Input Devices
Physical devices:
Two primary types of physical devices:
o Pointing devices: Allow user to indicate a position on the
screen, e.g., mouse.
o Incorporates one or more buttons
o Keyboard devices: Return character codes (ASCII code),
e.g., keyboard.
image source
Pointing Devices
Relative positioning:
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Devices such as the mouse, trackball, and joystick return
incremental inputs (or velocities) to the operating system
o
Must integrate these inputs to obtain the position of the curser on
the screen
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Roll of trackball
Absolute positioning:
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Devices such as the data tablet return a position directly to
the operating system
Input Devices
```

- Ä¢ Input devices can also be viewed as

```cpp
o Logical devices: characterized by how they influence
the application program, e.g., what is returned to the
program via the API
```

- Ä¢ An ùë•ùë•, ùë¶ùë¶ position on the screen?
- Ä¢ An object identifier for a menu item chosen?

```cpp
Both are performed by the same physical device (the
mouse, in this case) but what is returned to the program is
different.
Logical Input Devices
```

- Ä¢ Consider the C and C++ code

```cpp
o C++: cin >> x; \\ data in
o C: scanf(‚Äù%d‚Äù, &x); \\data out
```

- Ä¢ What is the input physical device?

```cpp
o Can‚Äôt tell from the code
o Could be keyboard, file, output from another
program
o A string is returned to the program regardless of
the physical device
Logical Input Devices (cont.)
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Graphics APIs define different types of logical devices based on the
kind of data (number, string, or position) the device provides :
```

‚Äì Locator: a device provides a position in world coordinates to the

```cpp
user program.
```

- Ä¢ Usually implemented via pointing device e.g., mouse
‚Äì Choice: a device that allows the user to select one of a discrete

```cpp
number of options, e.g., a menu item
```

- Ä¢ OpenGL can use widgets such as menus, and scroll bars
‚Äì String: a device that provides ASCII strings to the user program,

```cpp
e.g., via key presses
```

- Ä¢ String might be provided by a keyboard, or a file, or by

```cpp
pointing devices.
Logical Input Devices (cont.)
```

‚Äì Stroke: a device that returns an array of locations.
- Ä¢ pushing down a mouse button, starts the transfer of data into the

```cpp
specified array and then releasing of the button, ends the transfer
```

‚Äì Valuator: a device that returns analog input to the user

```cpp
program, e.g., a widget such as a slidebar, that allows the
user to input numerical data, such as a value or a range.
```

‚Äì Pick: a device that returns the identifier of an object on the

```cpp
display to the user program. Pick devices are used for
selecting individual objects or elements within a scene.
```

- Ä¢ GLUT provide functions to handle all these

```cpp
Input Modes
The manner by which physical and logical devices provide an input to
the application program, can be described in terms of two entities:
```

- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
Input devices produce a trigger which can be used to send a signal
to the operating system
o
o
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Measure ‚Äì value or a set of values returned to the program
Trigger ‚Äì manner in which a user can signal to the computer
that input is available and should be processed.
Button on mouse
Pressing or releasing a key
When triggered, input devices return information (their measure)
to the system
o
o
Locator returns position information
Keyboard returns ASCII code (string)
Input Modes
```

- Ä¢ We can obtain the measure of a device in three

```cpp
distinct modes.
```

‚Äì Request mode, sample mode and event mode.
- Ä¢ Each mode is defined by the relationship

```cpp
between the measure process and the trigger.
```

- Ä¢ Sample, request, and event are different modes

```cpp
of receiving inputs in a computer system.
Request Mode
```

- Ä¢ For request mode input, the measure is read by the

```cpp
program only when user triggers the device, when
requested.
```

- Ä¢ This mode is standard in non-graphical applications such as

```cpp
typical C programs
```

- Ä¢ A typical example is keyboard input:

```cpp
o The application program request a keyboard input from the user
o The user can type, erase (backspace), correct. The application
program hangs there until the enter (return) key (the trigger) is
depressed
Sample Mode
```

- Ä¢ It is an immediate mode (samples the input

```cpp
when the function call is made)
```

- Ä¢ Expects the measure to be present already at

```cpp
the sampling time (call time)
Request and Sample Mode
Request and sample modes are:
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
useful for situations where the program guides the user
but are not useful in applications where the user controls
the flow of the program.
For sample and request mode, user must identify which
device will provide the input
Event Mode
```

- Ä¢ Each time a device is triggered, an event is

```cpp
generated.
```

- Ä¢ Device measure is placed on an event queue

```cpp
Event Mode (cont.)
triggered
Event 3
Event 2
Event n
Dev n
Dev
Dev
```

1 Dev

```cpp
Event
Measure+[n]
Event queue
Multiple devices
Program
Multiple ways in
which a program can
use the events
What type of
event?
Associate a callback function with a specific type of event.
The OS queries the event queue regularly, and execute the callbacks corresponding to the events in
the queue
Event Categories
```

- Ä¢ Window event: resize, expose, iconify
- Ä¢ Mouse event: click one or more buttons
- Ä¢ Motion event: this refers to the mouse move event
(when the cursor is inside the window of the application

```cpp
program)
```

- Ä¢ Keyboard: press or release a key
- Ä¢ Idle: non-event

```cpp
o Define what should be done if no other event is in the event
queue
Callbacks
```

- Ä¢ We can define a callback function for each

```cpp
type of event that the graphics system
recognizes
```

- Ä¢ This user-supplied function is executed when

```cpp
the event occurs
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
For e.g., when a mouse button is pressed or released, the
callback function registered with glutMouseFunc() is
invoked
```

- Ä¢ glutMouseFunc(mymouse)

```cpp
mouse callback function
GLUT callbacks
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
GLUT recognizes a subset of the events recognized by any
particular window system (Windows, X, Macintosh)
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Examples of the GLUT functions that set the callbacks function
for various events
```

‚Äì glutDisplayFunc // for specifying the display callback function
‚Äì glutMouseFunc // for specifying the mouse callback function
‚Äì glutReshapeFunc // for specifying the window resize callback function
‚Äì glutKeyboardFunc // for specifying the keyboard input callback function
‚Äì glutIdleFunc // for specifying the idle callback function (what the program should

```cpp
do when no events take place)
```

‚Äì glutMotionFunc // for specifying the mouse motion callback function (what to do

```cpp
when the user moves the mouse over the GUI while pressing down one or more mouse
buttons)
glutMouseFunc
```

% usage

```cpp
void glutMouseFunc(void (*func)(int button, int state, int x, int y));
Example:
glutMouseFunc(myMouseFun);
```

% the function definition

```cpp
void myMouseFun(int button, int state, int x, int y)
{
```

% this is where you write code for what you want to do
% when a mouse ‚Äúevent‚Äù happens

```cpp
}
GLUT Event Loop
Recall that the last line in main.c for a program using
GLUT must be
glutMainLoop();
which puts the program in an infinite event loop
```

- Ä¢ In each pass through the event loop, GLUT
1. looks at the events in the queue
2. for each event in the queue, GLUT executes the appropriate

```cpp
callback function if one is registered
```

3. if no callback is registered for the event, the event is

```cpp
ignored
The display callback
```

- Ä¢ The display callback is executed whenever GLUT

```cpp
determines that the window should be refreshed, for
example
o When the window is first opened
o When the window is reshaped
o When a window is exposed
o When the user program decides it wants to change the display
```

- Ä¢ In main()

```cpp
o glutDisplayFunc(mydisplay) sets the display callback function
to ‚Äòmydisplay‚Äô.
o Every GLUT program must have a display callback
Posting redisplays
```

- Ä¢ Different events may need to invoke the display

```cpp
callback function
```

- Ä¢ We use glutPostRedisplay(); to mark that the current

```cpp
window needs to be redisplayed, which sets a flag.
```

- Ä¢ GLUT checks to see if the flag is set at the end of the

```cpp
event loop
```

- Ä¢ If the flag is set then the display callback function is

```cpp
executed

Introduction to menus in GLUT
Using a Pointing Device (Mouse)
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Mouse Event: When one of the mouse buttons is depressed
or released or the scroll wheel is moved. glutMouseFunc()
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Motion Event: When the mouse is moved within the window
with one of the buttons depressed. glutMotionFunc()
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
Passive Motion Event: When the mouse is moved within the
window without a button being held down.
glutPassiveMotionFunc()
The Mouse Callback
```

- Ä¢ The parameters passed to the function are:

```cpp
button - which mouse button caused the event
```

- Ä¢ GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON
- Ä¢ GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON
- Ä¢ GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON
- Ä¢ Wheel is still a button
ÔÉò
ÔÉò

```cpp
button == 3 (scroll forward)
button == 4 (scroll backwards)
state - state of that button
```

(GLUT_UP, GLUT_DOWN)

```cpp
x, y ‚Äì the mouse click position (in pixels) in the window
Terminating a Program
```

- Ä¢ We can use a simple mouse callback to terminate a

```cpp
program:
```

- Ä¢ Note that we ignore the x and y parameters in the

```cpp
example above.
Mouse Positioning (x, y)
```

- Ä¢ The mouse position on the screen window is usually measured in

```cpp
pixels with the origin at the top-left corner
```

‚Äì When the window is refreshed, it is done from top to bottom
- Ä¢ OpenGL uses a world coordinate system with the origin at the

```cpp
center of the window. Thus,
```

‚Äì you must invert the y coordinate passed to your callback

```cpp
function by the height of the window
```

‚Äì i.e., y = h ‚Äì y;

```cpp
GLUT(0,0)
y=(y/(h/2) ‚Äì 1.0;
h
```

‚Äì x=x/(w/2) ‚Äì 1.0;

```cpp
OpenGL(-1,1)
w
How to Obtain the Window Size
```

- Ä¢ To invert the y position, we need to know the window height
- Ä¢ Note that the window height can change during program

```cpp
execution
```

- Ä¢ We can use a global variable to keep track of the window

```cpp
height value
Using the Mouse Position
```

- Ä¢ In the next example, we show how to draw a small

```cpp
square at the location of the mouse each time the left
mouse button is clicked.
Example 1: Drawing squares at
clicked location of cursor
x+size,y+size
x-size,y+size
x,y
x-size,y-size
x+size,y-size
Note that in the drawSquare function,
variable h is a global variable storing
the height (in pixels) of the window.
h, size, points and i are global variables. 9
Example 2: Drawing a triangle by specifying
```

3 vertices

```cpp
Using the Motion Callback
```

- Ä¢ We can draw squares (or anything else) using the motion callback:
- Ä¢ We can also draw squares without depressing a button using the

```cpp
passive motion callback
Using the Keyboard Callback
Parameters passed to the mykey callback function are:
```

- Ä¢ key ‚Äì the ASCII code of the key depressed
- Ä¢ x, y - and mouse location at the time the key was pressed

```cpp
Example:
Special and Modifier Keys
```

- Ä¢ GLUT defines the special keys in glut.h
‚Äì Function key 1: GLUT_KEY_F1, GLUT_KEY_F12 ‚Ä¶
‚Äì Up arrow key: GLUT_KEY_UP, GLUT_KEY_RIGHT ‚Ä¶
‚Äì e.g., if (key == GLUT_KEY_F1 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
- Ä¢ Can also check whether one of the modifiers
‚Äì GLUT_ACTIVE_SHIFT
‚Äì GLUT_ACTIVE_CTRL
‚Äì GLUT_ACTIVE_ALT

```cpp
is depressed by
glutGetModifiers()
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key#/media/File:Qwerty.svg
Reshaping the Window
```

- Ä¢ We can reshape and resize the display window by

```cpp
pulling the corner of the window
```

- Ä¢ What happens to the display?
- Ä¢ The window in the application must be redrawn
- Ä¢ There are three possibilities:
1. We can display the whole world but force it to fit in the

```cpp
new window (this can alter the aspect ratio).
```

2. We can display part of the world.
3. We can alter the scale the of whole world to fit in the

```cpp
window and keep the aspect ratio.
Reshape Possibilities
```

- Ä¢ Three reshape possibilities

```cpp
Default
original
reshaped
The Reshape Callback
```

- Ä¢ Parameters passed to the function:

```cpp
w, h ‚Äì the width and height of new window (in pixels)
```

- Ä¢ What happens when the window is resized:

```cpp
o A redisplay is posted automatically at end of execution of
the callback
o GLUT has a default reshape callback but you probably
want to define your own
The Reshape Callback (cont.)
Suppose that the original display window is 500 (width) x 500 (height)
pixels, and the clipping volume is: left=-0.2, right=0.2, bottom=-0.2,
top=0.2, near=2.0, far=20.0.
Note that near and far clipping planes
should be positive; otherwise the clipping
volume would be taken as behind the
camera.

The Idle Callback
```

- Ä¢ Invoked when there are no other events. Its

```cpp
default is the null function pointer.
```

- Ä¢ Uses:
‚Äì continue to generate graphical primitives through a

```cpp
display function while nothing else is happening
```

‚Äì to produce an animated display.
- Ä¢ In main, we specify an idle callback,
‚Äì glutIdleFunc(idle);

```cpp
Example : Idle Callback
Toolkits and Widgets
```

- Ä¢ Most window systems provide a toolkit or library of

```cpp
functions for building user interfaces that use special
types of windows called widgets
```

- Ä¢ Widget sets include tools such as

```cpp
o Menus
o Slidebars
o Dials
o Input boxes
But toolkits tend to be platform dependent
```

- Ä¢ GLUT provides a few widgets including menus

```cpp
Menus
```

- Ä¢ GLUT supports pop-up menus

```cpp
o A menu can have submenus
```

- Ä¢ Three steps for setting up a menu:
1) Define entries for the menu
2) Define action for each menu item

```cpp
o Action carried out if an entry is selected
```

3) Attach menu to a mouse button

```cpp
Defining a Simple Menu
```

- Ä¢ In the main or init function:

```cpp
a unique ID returned by glut
name of the callback
function
clear screen
exit
entries that will appear when
right button is pressed
identifiers
Menu Actions
Example of a simple menu callback function:
Note when each menu is created, a unique id is returned by glut
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
To add a submenu, use glutAddSubMenu:
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
To add a menu entry, use glutAddMenuEntry:
```

- Ä¢

```cpp
To attach the current menu, use glutAttachMenu.

## Lecture 012: Computer Viewing


```cpp
CITS3003 Graphics & Animation
Lecture 12:
Computer Viewing
Objectives
```

- Ä¢ Introduce OpenGL viewing functions
- Learn how to place the camera
- Ä¢ Introduce the mathematics of projection
- Learn how to define orthographic and perspective projection
- gluLookAt(), glOrtho(), glFrustum(), gluPerspective()

```cpp
and their mat.h counterparts
```

- Ä¢ Introduce glMatrixMode()

```cpp
Computer Viewing
```

- Ä¢ There are three aspects of the viewing process, all of

```cpp
which are implemented in the pipeline,
```

1. Positioning the camera
- Ä¢ Setting the model-view matrix
2. Selecting a lens
- Ä¢ Setting the projection matrix
3. Clipping
- Ä¢ Setting the view volume

```cpp
Image credits : https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/faq-wideangle-lenses
The OpenGL Camera
```

- Ä¢ In OpenGL, initially the object and camera frames are the

```cpp
same
```

- The default model-view matrix is an identity
- Ä¢ The camera is located at the origin and points in the

```cpp
negative ùëßùëß direction
Objects specified in
the world frame
World frame origin
```

(0,0,0)

```cpp
Moving the Camera Frame
default frames
frames after translation by ùëëùëë
where ùëëùëë > 0
Translate(0.0,0.0,-d);
Camera frame origin
Default Frames
Translate the camera in
```

+z direction

```cpp
Moving the Camera Frame
We can move the objects in the ‚Äì ùëßùëß direction
o Moving the world frame
Default Frames
Translate the objects in -z
direction
Moving the Camera Frame
```

- Ä¢ If we want to visualize objects that have both positive and

```cpp
negative ùëßùëß ‚àívalues we can either
```

- Move the objects in the negative ùëßùëß direction
- Ä¢ Translate the world frame
- Move the camera in the positive ùëßùëß direction
- Ä¢ Translate the camera frame

```cpp
Default Frames
Translate the objects
in -z direction
Both of these views
are equivalent and are
determined by the
model-view matrix
Translate the camera in
```

+z direction

```cpp
Moving the Camera
We can move the camera to any desired position by a
sequence of rotations and translations
Example: side view at the
```

+ùë•ùë• axis looking towards the origin
1. Rotate the camera
2. Move it away from origin

```cpp
Model-view matrix ùëÄùëÄ = ùëáùëáùëáùëá
Moving the Camera ‚Äì OpenGL code
```

- Ä¢ Remember that the last transformation specified is

```cpp
first to be applied
```

// Using mat.h

```cpp
mat4 t = Translate (0.0, 0.0, -d);
mat4 ry = RotateY(90.0);
mat4 m = t*ry;
The LookAt() Function
```

- Ä¢ The GLU library contains the function gluLookAt which can be used

```cpp
to form the required model-view matrix.
void gluLookAt(eyeX, eyeY, eyeZ, centreX, centreY, centreZ, upX, upY, upZ)
```

- Ä¢ We need to define the eye (camera) position, the centre (fixation

```cpp
point), and an up direction. All are of type GLdouble.
Programmer defines:
```

- Ä¢eye position
- Ä¢LookAtpoint (at) and
- Ä¢Upvector (Updirection

```cpp
usually (0,1,0))
gluLookAt deprecated!
The LookAt() Function
```

- Ä¢ Alternatively, we can use LookAt() defined in mat.h
- The function returns a mat4 matrix.
- Can concatenate with modeling transformations

```cpp
Type: GLfloat
```

- Ä¢ Example:

```cpp
mat4 mv = LookAt(vec4 eye, vec4 at, vec4 up);
The LookAt() Function:
```

- Ä¢ Forms camera (u,v,n) frame
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢
- Ä¢

```cpp
n away from the view volume,
v is the cross product of n and up vector,
u at right angles to both n and v
Compose matrix to transform coordinates
```

(object to camera)

```cpp
Other Camera Viewing
Controls
n
```

- Ä¢ The LookAt() function is only for positioning the

```cpp
camera
```

- Ä¢ Other ways to specify camera position are:
- Yaw, pitch, roll (angles)
- Elevation, azimuth, twist (angles)
3D Viewing and View Volume

```cpp
How do we
set the
viewing
volume?
Previously
we set the
camera
position
Different View Volumes
Orthogonal View Volume
Perspective View Volume
Different view volume leads to different look
View volume parameters:
```

- Ä¢ Projection: Perspective, orthographic etc.,
- Ä¢ Near and far clipping planes- only the objects b/w near and far planes appear on

```cpp
the image
```

- Ä¢ Field of view ‚Äì determines how much of the world is captured in the picture
- Ä¢ Aspect ratio- w/h of the near plane

```cpp

Frustum
Near plane
Far plane
Objects outside the viewing
frustrum are clipped
Slide Content Credits: Emmanuel Agu, WPI, CS 543
Default Orthographic Projection
```

- Ä¢ The default projection in the eye (camera) frame is orthogonal
- Ä¢

```cpp
How to find the orthographic
projection of a 3D object on a
projection plane?
```

- Ä¢ Draw parallel lines from each object

```cpp
vertex to the projection plane.
```

- Ä¢ The projection center is at infinite
- Ä¢ Use (x,y) coordinates, just drop z

```cpp
coordinates
In orthographic projection, the projection lines are
parallel to each other and perpendicular to the
projection plane. Because there is no convergence
of light rays in orthographic projection, the
concept of focal length is not applicable
Image Credits: Emmanuel Agu, WPI, CS 543
Default Orthographic Projection
```

- Ä¢ The default projection in the eye (camera) frame is orthogonal
- Ä¢
- Ä¢ For a point ùê©ùê© = ùë•ùë•, ùë¶ùë¶, ùëßùëß, 1 T within the default view volume, it is

```cpp
projected to ùê©ùê©ùëùùëù = (ùë•ùë•ùëùùëù, ùë¶ùë¶ùëùùëù, ùëßùëßùëùùëù, ùë§ùë§ùëùùëù)T , where
```

ùë•ùë•ùëùùëù = ùë•ùë•, ùë¶ùë¶ùëùùëù = ùë¶ùë¶, ùëßùëßùëùùëù = 0, ùë§ùë§ùëùùëù = 1
- Ä¢ i.e., we can define
- ùêåùêå = 0

```cpp
and we can then write ùêèùêèùëùùëù = ùêåùêåùêåùêå
```

- Ä¢ In practice, we can let ùêåùêå = ùêàùêà and then set ùëßùëß to 0

```cpp
Image Credits: Emmanuel Agu, WPI, CS 543
Simple Perspective
In perspective projection, the camera‚Äôs
focal length ùëëùëë is finite
A simple perspective projection:
Center of projection is at the origin
Projection plane ùëßùëß = ùëëùëë, where ùëëùëë < 0
How to find the perspective projection of a
```

3D object on a projection plane?
- Ä¢ Draw line from object to projection center
- Ä¢ Calculate where each intersects projection

Orthogonal Viewing
Type: GLdouble
```

- Ä¢ The OpenGL orthogonal viewing function is:

```cpp
void glOrtho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far)
```

- Ä¢ Alternatively, we can use Ortho() defined in mat.h:

```cpp
mat4 Ortho(left,right,bottom,top,near,far)
Type: GLfloat
near and far are measured from camera

```

- Ä¢ Two steps
- Move center to origin

```cpp
T(-(left+right)/2, -(bottom+top)/2,(near+far)/2))
```

- Scale to have sides of length 2

```cpp
S(2/(left-right),2/(top-bottom),2/(near-far))

- Ä¢ To define a perspective transformation matrix for the

- Ä¢ Another way to get perspective projection is:

```cpp
mat4 Perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far)
which often provides a better interface
All are of type
GLfloat
Note:
aspect = w/h
fovy is an angle in degrees
The angle fovy is the angle between the top and bottom
planes of the clipping volume.

- Ä¢ The model-view matrix will take vertices in object coordinates and convert them to a representation in camera coordinates.
- Ä¢ The projection matrix will both carry out the desired projection‚Äîeither orthogonal or perspective‚Äîand convert a viewing volume

```cpp
specified in camera coordinates to fit inside the viewing cube in clip coordinates.
gluLookAt(), glOrtho(), glFrustum(), and
gluPerspective()
```

- Ä¢ Did you notice that‚Ä¶
- Ä¢ The ‚Äúgl‚Äù and ‚Äúglu‚Äù versions have no return

```cpp
arguments
```

- Ä¢ Whereas the mat.h versions LootAt(), Ortho(),

```cpp
Frustum() and Perspective() return 4x4 matrices of
type mat4
glMatrixMode()
glMatrixMode()
```

- Ä¢ Recall that OpenGL is a state machine

```cpp
Legacy OpenGL maintains several matrices for transforming points in 3D space
```

- Ä¢ glMatrixMode() defines the current matrix
- Ä¢ GL_MODELVIEW
- Ä¢ GL_PROJECTION
- Ä¢ GL_TEXTURE
- Ä¢ GL_COLOR
- Ä¢ glGet(GL_MATRIX_MODE) will return the current

```cpp
matrix mode
glMatrixMode()
glMatrixMode()
```

- Ä¢ When you define MODELVIEW with gluLookAt()
- OR
- Ä¢ When you define PROJECTION with glOrtho(),

```cpp
glFrustum(), or gluPerspective()
```

- Ä¢ The current matrix is multiplied by the new matrix

```cpp
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity() /*clear the matrix*/
glFrustrum(-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 1.5. 20.0)
