::Quiz 4 - CITS3003 Computer Graphics::
This is a 30-minute closed-book quiz. Answer all questions. Each question is worth equal marks. Total marks: 20

// Part A: True/False Questions
::Part A - True/False (10 marks)::
A vector has magnitude and direction but no fixed position in space, whereas a point specifies a location in space.{T}

The sum of a point and a vector is a point (applying a displacement vector to a point moves it to another point).{T}

The difference between two point positions is a vector.{T}

To change a point's coordinate representation from one coordinate frame to another, we must account for the difference in origins (translation) between the frames.{T}

OpenGL's viewport transformation maps normalized device coordinates to window (screen pixel) coordinates.{T}

In GLUT, the glutDisplayFunc callback is where you put your rendering code that draws the scene each time the window needs to be refreshed.{T}

Sampling input mode (for input devices) means the program explicitly polls the device state (e.g., checking mouse position every frame) rather than waiting for an event.{T}

In modern OpenGL, vertex attributes are stored in Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and accessed through Vertex Array Objects (VAOs).{T}

The perspective projection matrix transforms points from eye space to clip space, where the w component may be different from 1.{T}

In a typical OpenGL program, the depth buffer is cleared at the start of each frame with glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT).{T}

// Part B: Multiple Choice Questions
::Part B - Multiple Choice (10 marks)::
Which of the following is NOT a valid operation in affine geometry?{
~Adding a vector to a point
~Subtracting two points to get a vector
=Adding two points
~Scaling a vector
}

In a typical OpenGL program, which of these operations would you typically do LAST in your rendering loop?{
~Clear the buffers
~Update uniform variables
~Draw the geometry
=Swap the buffers
}

Which statement about the Model-View-Projection (MVP) matrix is correct?{
~It transforms vertices from model space directly to screen space
=It combines the model transform, view transform, and projection transform into one matrix
~It's only used in the fragment shader
~It's automatically provided by OpenGL
}

In modern OpenGL, what is the purpose of a Vertex Array Object (VAO)?{
~To store vertex data
=To store the state of vertex attribute configurations
~To store shader programs
~To store texture data
}

Which of these is NOT a typical stage in the OpenGL graphics pipeline?{
~Vertex Shader
~Rasterization
~Fragment Shader
=Memory Management
}

What is the purpose of the w component in homogeneous coordinates?{
~To represent time in animations
=To distinguish between points and vectors
~To store texture coordinates
~To represent color intensity
}

In a perspective projection, what happens to parallel lines in the scene?{
~They remain parallel in the projected image
=They converge to a vanishing point
~They become curved
~They disappear
}

Which of these is NOT a valid uniform variable type in GLSL?{
~mat4
~vec3
~sampler2D
=array
}

What is the purpose of the stencil buffer in OpenGL?{
~To store depth values
~To store color values
=To control which fragments are drawn
~To store texture coordinates
}

In modern OpenGL, what is the correct way to handle window resizing?{
~Automatically handled by OpenGL
=Update the viewport with glViewport and recalculate the projection matrix
~Recreate the window
~Ignore the resize event
}
